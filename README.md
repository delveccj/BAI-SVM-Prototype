## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

### Student Side:
```python
# Auto-detects GitHub username and Codespace info
github_username = os.environ['GITHUB_USER']
codespace_url = f"https://{os.environ['CODESPACE_NAME']}.github.dev"

# Connects to professor's server
requests.post(f"{server_url}/register", json=student_data)
```

### Professor Side:
```python
# Flask server with real-time WebSocket dashboard
app = Flask(__name__)
socketio = SocketIO(app)

# Receives student connections
@app.route('/register', methods=['POST'])
def register_student():
    # Store student info and notify dashboard
```

### Dashboard Features:
- 📊 Live student count
- 🔗 Direct Codespace links
- 📡 Ping/test connections
- ⏰ Connection timestamps
- 🎯 Status indicators

## 🔬 Testing the Prototype

### Prerequisites:
- GitHub account
- Access to GitHub Codespaces
- 2-3 volunteer students

### Test Steps:

1. **Professor Setup**:
   ```bash
   cd server/
   python professor_server.py
   # Server starts on http://localhost:8000
   ```

2. **Student Testing**:
   ```bash
   # Each student runs:
   python student/connect_to_professor.py
   # Enter professor's server URL when prompted
   ```

3. **Verification**:
   - ✅ Students appear on dashboard
   - ✅ Codespace links work
   - ✅ Real-time updates function
   - ✅ Connection persistence
