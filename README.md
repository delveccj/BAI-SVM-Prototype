## ðŸ“¸ Visual Connection Guide for Students

Follow these visual steps to connect to your professor's dashboard:

### Step 1: Start your Codespace
**Start your Codespace from this repository** - this will open VS Code in your browser with a fully configured development environment.

### Step 2: Start Live Share Session
