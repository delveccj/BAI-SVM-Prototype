## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

### Student Side:
```python
# Auto-detects GitHub username and Codespace info
github_username = os.environ['GITHUB_USER']
codespace_url = f"https://{os.environ['CODESPACE_NAME']}.github.dev"

# Connects to professor's server
requests.post(f"{server_url}/register", json=student_data)
```

### Professor Side:
```python
# Flask server with real-time WebSocket dashboard
app = Flask(__name__)
socketio = SocketIO(app)

# Receives student connections
@app.route('/register', methods=['POST'])
def register_student():
    # Store student info and notify dashboard
```
